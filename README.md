 A design for an Audio  Predictor is proposed. It takes  as  an  input  an  audio  file  and  tries  to  predict  the  next sample  in  the  future.  We  prepared  a  dataset  to  be  used  in the  experiment.  We  designed  some  basic  building  blocks  for a  basic  audio  predictor. The  experiment  runs on  a  single audio  file,  with  a  basic  model  using  Convolutional  Layer, as  a  starting  point  for  future  work.
